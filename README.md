# Snake

My first project in Rust, using SDL2. The code is not beautiful, but might be useful if you're looking for an example on how to use Rust, SDL2 and Serde (for loading JSON).

Note: the doctor\_worm.mp3 music file (which is a song by They Might Be Giants) and crunch.mp3 are probably copyrighted or something. You can disable them in the config, but I think the files will still be loaded.

## Features

- Different levels: reaching 3, 10, 20 and 30 eaten apples cause the snake to go faster and also add additional apples
- Music and sound effects
- Configuration file with options for disabling audio and allowing looping around the walls
- The Swedish language
- Beautiful graphics: the snake has eyes and the apples have green things on them
